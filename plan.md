# Project Plan: Coastal Escape Rentals

**Description:** A static website showcasing vacation rental properties along the California coast.

## Development Goals

- [ ] Set up the basic HTML structure for index.html, including header with navigation links, hero section, and a featured properties section.
- [ ] Populate index.html's hero section with compelling imagery and introductory text about Coastal Escape Rentals.
- [ ] Create the HTML structure for properties.html, including a property listing grid with placeholder property details.
- [ ] Implement a responsive grid layout for displaying property listings in properties.html, ensuring mobile compatibility.
- [ ] Create the HTML structure for about.html, including sections for company history, team members, and testimonials.
- [ ] Populate about.html with content detailing the company's mission, vision, and values.
- [ ] Design the HTML structure for contact.html, incorporating a contact form, contact information, and a Google Maps embed.
- [ ] Implement form validation and submission handling for the contact form in contact.html (simulated for a static site, e.g., showing a thank you message).
- [ ] Add Tailwind CSS styling to assets/css/style.css for a consistent visual design across all pages, including typography, colors, and layout.
